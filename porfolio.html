                    <h3>WEB BASED GRAPHICAL PASSEWORD AUTHENTICATION</h3>
                    <p>Password is a secrete that is used for authentication. Graphical password authentication
                        system is an authentication system that uses some combination of graphical images replacing
                        the regular passwords .Therefore graphical passwords offer better security than text and other
                        forms of passwords which indeed protects from different types of cyber attacks.<br><br>
                        The advantages of using this kind of authentication interface is that it provides a way of
                        making more human friendly passwords and this a kind of recognition-recall technique used
                        for this the user need not to remember the password they can just recall the images and the
                        authentication is done</p>

                    <h3>IDENTIFICATION OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS USING BLOCKCHAI</h3>
                    <p>Blockchain technology which does not require any third party and verification will
                        be done by software algorithm itself without involvement of any third party.In this
                        to avoid forge counterfeit we are converting all productsdetails/barcode into digital
                        signatures and this digital signatures will be stored in Blockchain server as this
                        Blockchain server support tamper proof data storage and nobody can hack or alter
                        its data and if by an chance if its data alter then verification get failed at next block
                        storage and user may get intimation about data alter.<br> <br>
                        In Blockchain each data will be stored by verifying old hash codes and if old hash
                        codes remain unchanged then data will be consider as original and unchanged and
                        then new transaction data will be appended to Blockchain as new block. For each
                        new data storage all blocks hash code will be verified.</p><br>

                <h3>UDP SOCKET INTERFACE FOR 3D PLOTTING:</h3>
                <p>The main aim of the project is to develop real time interface for 3D plotting of an
                    aerospace vehicle using UDP- socket..
                    First part of our project is to study socket program operating system and QT
                    programming on linux environment. UDP socket routines enable simple IP communication
                    using the User Datagram protocol (UDP). The UDP runs on the top of the IP and was device
                    for application that do not require reliability, acknowlegdment or flow control features at the
                    transport layer.<br> <br>
                    Hardware-in-loop (HIL)simulation is a technique that is used in the development and
                    testing of complex real-time embedded systems. HIL simulation provides an effective
                    testing platform by adding the complexity of the process-actuator system, known as a plant,
                    to the test platform. The complexity of the plant under control is included in testing and
                    development by adding a mathematical representation of all related dynamic systems. These
                    mathematical representations are referred to as the "plant simulation".</p> <br>
